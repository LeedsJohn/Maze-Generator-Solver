# Maze-Generator-Solver
Depth First Search Maze Generator and Solver

When we were learning about stacks in my Data Structures class, my professor mentioned that one of the applications is generating and solving mazes.
This caught my attention, so I attempted to implement a depth first search maze generation and solving algorithm. I also created a terminal display.
This turned out well on my end, but some people complained about it jumping around. Regardless, it is a clever proof of concept.

In the future, I would like to add on more maze generation algorithms to this project. There are also many obvious stylistic improvements I could make
now that I am slightly more experienced in C++.
